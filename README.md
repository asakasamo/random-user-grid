# Random User Grid
A full-stack Javascript project that displays a list of random users by gender. Random users are fetched from the 
Random User Generator API at [Randomuser.me](Randomuser.me).

## How to run

### Running with the server
*Node.js must be installed to run the server.

1. Clone the project to a local directory.
2. Start the server. To do this, simply run ```npm start``` from the project directory.
3. Check the console output. The server will run on a random available port on localhost, which is provided to you in the console output. 
4. Visit the provided localhost address in your browser of choice to view the project. (Example: ```localhost:58653```)
5. You're done! Click the "male" or "female" button to display a random list of users.

### Running without the server
You may also run the project without running the server; it'll function the same. 

1. Clone the project to a local directory.
2. Open index.html in your browser.
3. That's all! Click the "male" or "female" button to display a random list of users.
